# Gesture recognition with Hidden Markov Model(HMM)

This is a function for gesture recognition on IMU data(acceleration and rotation rates) with Hidden Markov Model. There is also a branch containing signal filtering with Unscented Kalman filter.

## Getting Started
1. For test, switch 'mode' to 1 in try.py as and change test set folder to desired path, then: 
'''
python try.py
'''
note: result will be printed and stored in ./res

### Prerequisites

Python 3
